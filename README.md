# Diamond Price Prediction
Predicting diamond prices can provide valuable insights into the diamond market. This prediction can help businesses optimize their pricing strategies, identify market trends, and make informed decisions about diamond purchases and sales to invest in the market.
Thus, in this project, the goal is to predict diamond prices based on a dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
In this project the models that have been used are 
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree 
* Random Forest. 

After training the models and applying them on test data we noticed that Random Forest is the best regressor with the least ** RMSE **.
